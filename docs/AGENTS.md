# Documentation

## üéØ Document Focus and Perspective

The documentation should focus on **Wazuh Dashboard as an independent product or application**, and not only at the level of Wazuh _plugins_ or excessive references to OpenSearch.

The main objective is for this to be a complete resource (**source of truth**) that reduces the need to rewrite responses to common or frequently asked questions.

## üí° Content Strategy

The documentation should address the topic as follows:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **General Introduction (Entry Point)**

- Explain each Dashboard feature in general terms.
- Describe in general terms **what they allow the user to do** to leverage the data.
- A paragraph can be dedicated to each concept if they remain on the same page.

| Aspect            | Recommended Action                                                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language/Tone** | Use a **more formal** and professional language.                                                                                 |
| **Commands**      | Avoid colloquial terms like "**paste**". It is suggested to use "Replace the _placeholder_ with..." or a more formal equivalent. |
| **Information**   | Provide **comprehensive documentation** to enable straightforward resolution of queries through direct reference links.          |
